abstract = {In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of our writer-independent online handwriting recognition system frog on hand. The focus of this work concerns the presentation of the classification/training approach, which we call cluster generative statistical dynamic time warping (CSDTW). CSDTW is a general, scalable, HMM-based method for variable-sized, sequential data that holistically combines cluster analysis and statistical sequence modeling. It can handle general classification problems that rely on this sequential type of data, e.g., speech recognition, genome processing, robotics, etc. Contrary to previous attempts, clustering and statistical sequence modeling are embedded in a single feature space and use a closely related distance measure. We show character recognition experiments of frog on hand using CSDTW on the UNIPEN online handwriting database. The recognition accuracy is significantly higher than reported results of other handwriting recognition systems. Finally, we describe the real-time implementation of frog on hand on a Linux Compaq iPAQ embedded device.},

abstract = {The development of handwriting speed and legibility in 900 children in Grades 19 was examined. Each student completed 3 writing tasks: copying a paragraph, writing a narrative, and writing an essay. The children's speed of handwriting on the copying task typically increased from one grade to the next, but the pace of development was uneven during the intermediate grades and leveled off in Grade 9 as speed began to approximate adult speeds. In contrast, improvement in handwriting legibility on the 3 writing tasks was primarily limited to the intermediate grades. Girls' handwriting was more legible than boys' handwriting, and the girls wrote faster in Grades 1, 6, and 7. Right-handers were also faster than left-handers, but there was no difference in the legibility of their written products. Finally, handwriting speed contributed significantly to the prediction of legibility on the narrative and expository writing tasks, but the contribution was small, accounting for only 1 \% of the variance.},

In the early 1980s, Card, Moran, and Newell (1983) presented the laws as design principles for developers to maximize usability in the design of human-computer interfaces. A search of the current human-computer interaction (HCI) literature, however, will reveal that the Hick-Hyman Law failed to gain momentum in the field of HCI, whereas Fitts' Law received, and continues to receive, substantial attention. This article begins with a discussion the common information theoretical concepts of the two laws, and then examines each law with respect to its origins, theoretical formulation, theoretical development, research, and applications and examines the possible contributing factors responsible for the failure of Hick-Hyman Law to gain momentum in the field.},

@article{Diedrichsen2010,
abstract = {Human motor behavior is constantly adapted through the process of error-based learning. When the motor system encounters an error, its estimate about the body and environment will change, and the next movement will be immediately modified to counteract the underlying perturbation. Here, we show that a second mechanism, use-dependent learning, simultaneously changes movements to become more similar to the last movement. In three experiments, participants made reaching movements toward a horizontally elongated target, such that errors in the initial movement direction did not have to be corrected. Along this task-redundant dimension, we were able to induce use-dependent learning by passively guiding movements in a direction angled by 8 from the previous direction. In a second study, we show that error-based and use-dependent learning can change motor behavior simultaneously in opposing directions by physically constraining the direction of active movements. After removal of the constraint, participants briefly exhibit an error-based aftereffect against the direction of the constraint, followed by a longer-lasting use-dependent aftereffect in the direction of the constraint. In the third experiment, we show that these two learning mechanisms together determine the solution the motor system adopts when learning a motor task.},

abstract = {For an online handwriting recognition system equipped with a writer-independent classifier to progressively improve the recognition performance for a specific writer with an increase in his/her handwriting inputs, the following method is proposed: (1) for a handwriting pattern that causes a recognition error, a two-class classifier of the corresponding class is (re)constructed as a part of a writer-dependent classifier, separately from the writer-independent one, where artificially generated examples are used to compensate for lack of training examples. (2) In the recognition stage, the writer-independent classifier is applied first, and then the constructed writer-dependent classifier is used only in cases in which a result obtained by the writer-independent classifier possesses lower reliability. We examine the effectiveness of the proposed method using 6,000 Japanese Hiragana characters written by 3 users. As a result, an average recognition rate of 98.07\% was obtained by the exclusive use of the writer-independent classifier. On the other hand, the rate improved to 99.92\% with at most 7 (re)constructions of a writer-dependent classifier.},

abstract = {Burnashev in 1976 gave an exact expression for the reliability function of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) with noiseless feedback. A coding scheme that achieves this exponent needs, in general, to know the statistics of the channel. Suppose now that the coding scheme is designed knowing only that the channel belongs to a family Q of DMCs. Is there a coding scheme with noiseless feedback that achieves Burnashev's exponent uniformly over Q at a nontrivial rate? We answer the question in the affirmative for two families of channels (binary symmetric, and Z). For these families we show that, for any given fraction, there is a feedback coding strategy such that for any member of the family: i) guarantees this fraction of its capacity as rate, and ii) guarantees the corresponding Burnashev's exponent. Therefore, for these families, in terms of delay and error probability, the knowledge of the channel becomes asymptotically irrelevant in feedback code design: there are blind schemes that perform as well as the best coding scheme designed with the foreknowledge of the channel under use. However, a converse result shows that, in general, even for families that consist of only two channels, such blind schemes do not exist.},

Related problems like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the prob- lem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we intro- duce a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed fea- tures. Finally, we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks.},

algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based
learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture,
gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex
decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as
handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews
various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and
compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task.
Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal
with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other
techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of
multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition,
and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer
networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally
using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance
measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described.
Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the
flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network
for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional
neural network character recognizers combined with global training
techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.
It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day

abstract = {This letter analyzes the Fisher kernel from a statistical point of view. The Fisher kernel is a particularly interesting method for constructing a model of the posterior probability that makes intelligent use of unlabeled data (i.e., of the underlying data density). It is important to analyze and ultimately understand the statistical properties of the Fisher kernel. To this end, we first establish sufficient conditions that the constructed posterior model is realizable (i.e., it contains the true distribution). Realizability immediately leads to consistency results. Subsequently, we focus on an asymptotic analysis of the generalization error, which elucidates the learning curves of the Fisher kernel and how unlabeled data contribute to learning. We also point out that the squared or log loss is theoretically preferable-because both yield consistent estimators-to other losses such as the exponential loss, when a linear classifier is used together with the Fisher kernel. Therefore, this letter underlines that the Fisher kernel should be viewed not as a heuristics but as a powerful statistical tool with well-controlled statistical properties.},

abstract = {The nearest neighbor decision rule assigns to an unclassified sample point the classification of the nearest of a set of previously classified points. This rule is independent of the underlying joint distribution on the sample points and their classifications, and hence the probability of errorRof such a rule must be at least as great as the Bayes probability of errorR\^{}\{$\backslash$ast\}--the minimum probability of error over all decision rules taking underlying probability structure into account. However, in a large sample analysis, we will show in theM-category case thatR\^{}\{$\backslash$ast\} $\backslash$leq R $\backslash$leq R\^{}\{$\backslash$ast\}(2 --MR\^{}\{$\backslash$ast\}/(M-1)), where these bounds are the tightest possible, for all suitably smooth underlying distributions. Thus for any number of categories, the probability of error of the nearest neighbor rule is bounded above by twice the Bayes probability of error. In this sense, it may be said that half the classification information in an infinite sample set is contained in the nearest neighbor.},

@article{Shannon1948,
abstract = {THE recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist1 and Hartley2 on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

We study the influence of each stage of the computation on performance, concluding that fine-scale gradients, fine orientation binning, relatively coarse spatial binning, and high-quality local contrast normalization in overlapping descriptor blocks are all important for good results. The new approach gives near-perfect separation on the original MIT pedestrian database, so we introduce a more challenging dataset containing over 1800 annotated human images with a large range of pose variations and backgrounds.},

abstract = {Since their first inception more than half a century ago, automatic reading systems have evolved substantially, thereby showing impressive performance on machine-printed text. The recognition of handwriting can, however, still be considered an open research problem due to its substantial variation in appearance. With the introduction of Markovian models to the field, a promising modeling and recognition paradigm was established for automatic handwriting recognition. However, so far, no standard procedures for building Markov-model-based recognizers could be established though trends toward unified approaches can be identified. Markov Models for Handwriting Recognition provides a comprehensive overview of the application of Markov models in the research field of handwriting recognition, covering both the widely used hidden Markov models and the less complex Markov-chain or n-gram models. First, the text introduces the typical architecture of a Markov model-based handwriting recognition system, and familiarizes the reader with the essential theoretical concepts behind Markovian models. Then, the text gives a thorough review of the solutions proposed in the literature for open problems in applying Markov model-based approaches to automatic handwriting recognition.},

abstract = {In some communication problems, it is a good assumption that the channel consists of an additive white Gaussian noise forward link and an essentially noiseless feedback link. In this paper, we study channels where no bandwidth constraint is placed on the transmitted signals. Such channels arise in space communications. It is known that the availability of the feedback link cannot increase the channel capacity of the noisy forward link, but it can considerably reduce the coding effort required to achieve a given level of performance. We present a coding scheme that exploits the feedback to achieve considerable reductions in coding and decoding complexity and delay over what would be needed for comparable performance with the best known (simplex) codes for the one-way channel. Our scheme, which was motivated by the Robbins-Monro stochastic approximation technique, can also be used over channels where the additive noise is not Gaussian but is still independent from instant to instant. An extension of the scheme for channels with limited signal bandwidth is presented in a companion paper (Part II).},

Our survey results show that thumb keyboard is the fastest text entry method after the standard QWERTY keyboard, and that Twiddler is fastest amongst non-QWERTY methods. Moreover, we survey how text entry errors were handled in these studies. Finally, we conducted a user study to detect which effect different error-handling methodologies have on text entry performance metrics. Our study results show that the way human errors are handled has indeed a significant effect on all frequently used error metrics.},

Six participants used all three input methods to enter both normal text and addresses. Participants indicated that they preferred to use the standard keyboard. The average input rate for handwriting was fastest, but also much more variable than the other methods. Despite its speed, participants generally found it difficult to write comfortably and legibly on the small (35x115 mm) display. The input rate for the standard keyboard was more than twice the input rate for the predictive keyboard. These results suggest that, for small devices, neither handwriting recognition nor predictive keyboards would effectively replace the standard keyboard layout. Even with perfect handwriting recognition, users seem to prefer tapping on a small standard keyboard unless the device's hardware design allows comfortable handwriting input.},

abstract = {Due to its large number of degrees of freedom and extensive connection to the brain, the human hand has been used to create channels of communication for a variety of human-machine systems. However, a fundamental question about the hand channel is still unanswered: what is its information capacity? This study aims to provide quantitative indication of effectiveness of the hand as a communication channel. We estimated that per gesture, the thumb and the index finger may deliver at most 10 and 7 bits of information, respectively. Based on this, we derived an upper bound for the information capacity of the hand in gesture-based communication: 150 b/s. Knowing this bound is critical to evaluating the potential and limitation of the hand channel for various forms of human-machine interactions.},

abstract = {Mobile information technologies are theoretically well-suited to digitally accomodate informal note-taking, with the notes often recorded quickly and under less than ideal circumstances. Unfortunately, user adoption of mobile support for informal note-taking has been hindered in large part by slow text entry techniques. Building on research confirming people's ability to recognize erroneous text, this study explores two simple modifications to Graffiti-based text entry with the goal of increasing text entry speed: disabling text correction and disabling visual feedback. As expected, both modifications improved text entry speed at the cost of recognizability. To address the decrease in recognizability, a multiapproach text-enhancement algorithm is introduced with the goal of modifying the erroneous note to facilitate the process of recalling the event or activity that originally motivated the note. A study with 75 participants confirmed that the proposed approach of discouraging user-initiated error correction during note-taking, enhancing the resulting erroneous notes, and facilitating recall with enhanced alternative lists, increased note-taking speed by 47\% with no negative impact on the participants' ability to recall important details about the scenarios which prompted the note-taking activities. This research highlighs the importance and efficacy of shifting the focus from accuracy to recallability when examining the overall efficacy of informal notes. The proposed modifications and adaptations produce significant benefits and have important implications for how mobile technologies are designed to support both informal note-taking and text entry in general.},

One of the latest research trends is to abandon the traditional tapping interaction in favor of more natural gesture-based interactions on these key- boards. The interpretation of the gestures is performed through sketch-based techniques. In this paper we present the sketch-based technology re- lated to the interpretation of the gestures needed to enter text through KeyScretch, a novel text entry method which has been proven to be more efﬁcient than the traditional tapping-based method. The method enables text entry through the input of gestures associated to word chunks. The gestures are guided by a menu which appears around a key of the keyboard as soon as the user presses it. The proposed procedures improve the interpretation of the gestures and consequently increase the accuracy of the method. This improvement is measured through a simula- tion in which the sketch-based recognition is compared to the target-based menu item selection through an estimation of the error rate.},

abstract = {In this paper, we extend and overview wide families of Alpha-, Beta- and Gamma-divergences and discuss their fundamental properties. In literature usually only one single asymmetric (Alpha, Beta or Gamma) divergence is considered. We show in this paper that there exist families of such divergences with the same consistent properties. Moreover, we establish links and correspondences among these divergences by applying suitable nonlinear transformations.

Thus, the user is required to look at the screen to interact with these devices. In this paper, we present SemFeel, a tactile feedback system which informs the user about the presence of an object where she touches on the screen and can offer additional semantic information about that item. Through multiple vibration motors that we attached to the backside of a mobile touch-screen device, SemFeel can generate different patterns of vibration, such as ones that flow from right to left or from top to bottom, to help the user interact with a mobile device. Through two user studies, we show that users can distinguish ten different patterns, including linear patterns and a circular pattern, at approximately 90\% accuracy, and that SemFeel supports accurate eyes-free interactions.},

Each student completed 3 writing tasks: copying a paragraph, writing a narrative, and writing an essay. The children's speed of handwriting on the copying task typically increased from one grade to the next, but the pace of development was uneven during the intermediate grades and leveled off in Grade 9 as speed began to approximate adult speeds. In contrast, improvement in handwriting legibility on the 3 writing tasks was primarily limited to the intermediate grades. Girls' handwriting was more legible than boys' handwriting, and the girls wrote faster in Grades 1, 6, and 7. Right-handers were also faster than left-handers, but there was no difference in the legibility of their written products. Finally, handwriting speed contributed significantly to the prediction of legibility on the narrative and expository writing tasks, but the contribution was small, accounting for only 1 \% of the variance.},

abstract = {Burnashev in 1976 gave an exact expression for the reliability function of a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) with noiseless feedback. A coding scheme that achieves this exponent needs, in general, to know the statistics of the channel. Suppose now that the coding scheme is designed knowing only that the channel belongs to a family Q of DMCs. Is there a coding scheme with noiseless feedback that achieves Burnashev's exponent uniformly over Q at a nontrivial rate? We answer the question in the affirmative for two families of channels (binary symmetric, and Z). For these families we show that, for any given fraction, there is a feedback coding strategy such that for any member of the family: i) guarantees this fraction of its capacity as rate, and ii) guarantees the corresponding Burnashev's exponent. Therefore, for these families, in terms of delay and error probability, the knowledge of the channel becomes asymptotically irrelevant in feedback code design: there are blind schemes that perform as well as the best coding scheme designed with the foreknowledge of the channel under use. However, a converse result shows that, in general, even for families that consist of only two channels, such blind schemes do not exist.},

The results translated into 10.3 - 11.5 bits/sec. (I'm not sure how he came up with this numbers. My guess is that he assume a Gaussian channel and use the capacity formula). 
        
In the second experiment, the task was to transfer plastic discs from one pin to another. Again, the distance between the pins were varied, as well as the difference between the diameter of the pins and the diameter of the center hole of the discs. The results suggested 7.5 to 10.4 bits/sec.
        
In the third experiment, the task was to transfer pins from one set of holes to another. The size of the pins and the distance between the holes were varied. The results suggested 8.9 to 12.6 bits/sec.

Six participants used all three input methods to enter both normal text and addresses. Participants indicated that they preferred to use the standard keyboard. The average input rate for handwriting was fastest, but also much more variable than the other methods. Despite its speed, participants generally found it difficult to write comfortably and legibly on the small (35x115 mm) display. The input rate for the standard keyboard was more than twice the input rate for the predictive keyboard.

Even with perfect handwriting recognition, users seem to prefer tapping on a small standard keyboard unless the device's hardware design allows comfortable handwriting input.},
